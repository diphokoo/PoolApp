## Clarification Needed

To properly assist with regenerating code, I need additional information:

1. Which specific part of the code needs to be regenerated?
2. What issues or problems with the current code need to be addressed?
3. Are there any specific requirements or changes that should be implemented in the regenerated code?
4. Should any particular features be added, removed, or modified?

Looking at the current codebase, I can see it's a React application with:
- Firebase integration
- Routing functionality
- Multiple pages (Home, Leaderboard, Match Results, Create Fixtures)
- Tailwind CSS for styling

Please provide more details about what aspects need regeneration so I can better assist you.
